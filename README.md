# NSMtoKNN

This code is the supplementary material for the paper **NSM Converges to a k-NN Regressor UnderLoose Lipschitz Estimates** by Emilio T. Maddalena and Colin N. Jones, published in the IEEE Control Systems Letters, Volume 4, Issue 4, Oct. 2020.

It contains two MATLAB examples that illustrate the convergence of Nonlinear Set Membership models to the Nearest Neighbor one, including an univariate case where this process is guaranteed to be monotonic.
