# NSMtoKNN

This code is the supplementary material for the paper **NSM Converges to a k-NN Regressor Under Loose Lipschitz Estimates** by Emilio T. Maddalena and Colin N. Jones, published in the *IEEE Control Systems Letters*, Volume 4, Issue 4, Oct. 2020.

It contains two MATLAB examples that illustrate the convergence of Nonlinear Set Membership models to the Nearest Neighbor ones.
